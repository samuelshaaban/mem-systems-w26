## Tasks

Mostly the same as last time.

* Do the background reading and read the paper for next week. 
* Decide on teams for projects. See the [syllabus][].
* Ask any questions about the course structure or content in this lesson's [discussion topic][topic].
* Pick a paper from the [schedule][] whose discussion you want to lead. 
  Claim it by opening a pull request that modifies [`content.toml`][cont-gh] to fill in your name on one of the `leader = "TBD"` lines.
