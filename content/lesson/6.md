## Notes

See my slides on [Canvas](https://canvas.oregonstate.edu/courses/2028992/files/116220123?module_item_id=26497541)

Take a look at this [coherence protocol visualization][cc]. This was generated by [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview) in about 30min. I haven't
verified the protocol correctness, so take it with a big grain of salt, but it should give you a basic idea of how
coherence traffic propagates on the coherence network (bus). 

[Here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=216747) is a description of the Alpha 21064, the predecessor of the core arch referenced in the paper.

Here are a few other influential papers/books written by Luiz Barroso:
- [Failure Trends in a Large Disk Drive Population](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/disk_failures.pdf)
- [The Case for Energy-Proportional Computing](https://www.barroso.org/publications/ieee_computer07.pdf)
- [Attack of the Killer Microseconds](https://www.barroso.org/publications/AttackoftheKillerMicroseconds.pdf)
- [The Tail at Scale](https://www.barroso.org/publications/TheTailAtScale.pdf)
- [The Datacenter as a Computer](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-01761-2)
- [Availability in Globally Distributed Storage Systems](https://research.google/pubs/availability-in-globally-distributed-storage-systems/)
- [Bluetooth Contact Tracing for COVID](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-36495-z)

RIP Luiz.

## Tasks

Mostly the same as previous times.

* Do the background reading and read the paper for next week. 
* Ask any questions about the course structure or content in this paper's [discussion topic][topic].
